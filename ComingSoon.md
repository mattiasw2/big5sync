## Reporting of Sync Results ##
Currently, there is no way to see the synchronization results after each sync. This may come in a future release.

## Uni-Directional Synchronization ##
Currently, our software simply keeps every folder under the same tag in sync. In future, we will look at including options for setting sources and targets, so that the synchronization is uni-directional.

## More Filters ##
Currently, Syncless only provides file extension filters. In the future, we will provide more types of filter like size filter and folder filter.

## Allow Naming of Profile ##
Currently, all profiles will be merged. In the future, the user will be able to name their profiles and only profiles with the same name will be merged.

## Suggestion Box ##
