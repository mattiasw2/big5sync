_"Syncless is a work of beauty combined with superb functionality. This opensource tool is one of its kind in synchronization, using a method that is both simple and brilliant, i.e., tagging." - [Addictive Tips](http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/syncless-best-free-file-sync-software/)_
<br><br>

<i>"You won't find a shortage of file syncing applications, but Syncless is the first we've reviewed that supports tag-based synchronization. Rather than simply plugging in folder X and folder Y and telling Syncless to keep them in sync—although you're free to do so—Syncless groups tagged items together so you can easily tag multiple folders as "Photos" and sync them all to each other." - <a href='http://lifehacker.com/5517269/syncless-is-a-tag+based-file-synchronizer'>Lifehacker</a></i>
<br><br>

<i>"Overall we liked the concept of tags for file sync and Syncless proved to be a really useful application." - <a href='http://www.nirmaltv.com/2010/04/14/syncless-is-an-useful-file-sync-tool-for-windows/'>Life Rocks 2.0</a></i>

<h2>Why Tagging?</h2>

<br><br>
<h2>Why Syncless?</h2>
What makes <b><i>Syncless</i></b> so unique is the way synchronization is performed. The current paradigm in the way file synchronization is done is to create a job by setting folder pairs and then start synchronizing. Syncless does away with this completely by introducing the concept of folder <b><i>tagging</i></b>.<br>
<br>
The concept of tagging has been applied by notable applications in various interesting ways. Facebook allows users to tag people into photos and almost all blog engines allows users to tag posts as a form of categorization. The main reason behind the increased use of tagging is because tagging is a very natural thought process that everyone does when trying to associate words or concepts with the unfamiliar.<br>
<br>
By applying this simple and natural idea to file synchronization, users will be able to synchronize folders by simply tagging different folders with the same tag, resulting in a near seamless experience in synchronization.  A group of folders with the same tag will always be kept in sync automatically in real-time by <b>Syncless</b>, without any need for user intervention.<br>
<br>

<br><br>
<h2>Why Another Sync Tool?</h2>
Despite the many synchronization tools that are on the market, only a few of them stand out by offering features which are most useful to the user such as multiple folders synchronization, automatic synchronization, portability and versioning. In addition, the current paradigm for synchronization tools to initiate file synchronization: is to create folder pairs and then start synchronizing. <b><i>Syncless</i></b> focuses on making synchronization seamless and introduces a completely refreshing and natural way of doing file synchronization.<br>
<br><br>
<h2>Vision</h2>
To keep in line with our concept of seamless synchronization, the vision of this product is "Tag it and forget about it". You will not need to do anything on your part once a folder has been tagged.<br>
<br><br>
<h2>More Features!</h2>
In addition to the ability to simply tag your folders, Syncless provides the following:<br>
<br>
<ol><li><b>Synchronization of multiple folders</b>
<blockquote>Tag any number of folders under the same tag, and they will all be kept in sync, unlike most products on the market, which can only handle 2-way synchronization<br>
</blockquote></li><li><b>Real-time synchronization (Seamless mode)</b>
<blockquote>All folders under the same tag will be kept in sync, without any interference from you<br>
</blockquote></li><li><b>Sync across multiple computers</b>
<blockquote>Plug in your thumb drive, and watch your files and tags get synchronized!<br>
</blockquote></li><li><b>Configuration of tags</b>
<blockquote>Configure each tag to filter the kinds of files to include or exclude<br>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why is this project called big5sync?</h3>
We call ourselves BIG5, and thus this project was initially called big5sync. Unfortunately, Google Code Project Hosting currently does not support the ability to rename a project, so we are stuck with it. Of course, we can always create a new project, but have decided not to anyway :P. We are BIG5 ;).<br>
<br><br>
<h3>Where can I post feedback and issues?</h3>
If you find any issue when using Syncless, feel free to post it directly at the Issues page. However to discuss those issues more in-depth, we have a google group at <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/Syncless'>http://groups.google.com/group/Syncless</a>. We welcome you to give more comments and suggestions there on how to make our product better for your use.<br>
<br><br>
<h3>Why is this penguin here?</h3>
This penguin was placed here while we did not have a release version ready yet. As such, we decided to let him remain here since he has been a part of this project.<br>
