#### N-Way synchronization ####
N here refers to any number. Most of the synchronization tools in the market are only capable of 2-way synchronization, that is, they can only keep 2 folders in sync under each sync job. N-way means that each job, or in the case of Syncless, tag, can have any number of folders under it, and all of them will be kept in sync.


#### Origin ####
An origin is one of the folders to be kept in sync. For example, if a user keeps `C:\Documents\Lecture Notes` and `E:\School\Lectures` in sync, then these 2 folders are both origins.


#### Portability ####
Portability refers to the aspect of a software not needing installation, and can simply be run from anywhere.


#### Root path ####
Refer to [origin](SynclessGlossary#Origin.md).

#### Source ####
Refer to [origin](SynclessGlossary#Origin.md).

#### Seamless mode ####
Folders will be automatically kept in sync without any user intervention.


#### Tag ####
Identity or labels associated with folders. Folders with the same tag will be kept in sync.
